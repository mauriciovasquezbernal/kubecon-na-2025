## Picking up an issue

Look for issues with the ["good first
issue"](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)
label in the repository, and pick one that interests you. Make sure to comment
on the issue to let others know you're working on it.
