# Implementing our first gadget

In this track we will introduce how you can build your own gadget. Gadgets are a
fundamental component of Inspektor Gadget and act as the mechanism for data
collection. They are bundled in an OCI image an consist of 3 parts:
1. The eBPF program which gathers the low level date
2. The YAML file which includes the metadata about the gadget, so the consumer
   knows about its functionality
3. An optional WASM layer for userspace processing and enrichment

In this track we want to create a gadget which traces every process opening a
file - be it for writing or reading. It is important to have visibility into
these processes for a multitude of reasons such as, from a security perspective,
there are files which we want to monitor closely, for example critical
configuration files such as etc/passwd should be monitored for unauthorized
access. With the framework provided by Inspektor Gadgets this can be achieved
easily. Even better is the out of the box enrichment for containers and
Kubernetes.

This lab requires some knowledge of the C programming language and golang for
the optional WASM part. It is split into 4 tasks, you can find the proposed
solutions for them in the solutions folder.

Let's start our journey and create a folder dedicated to our gadget:
```bash
~ $ mkdir mygadget
~ $ cd mygadget
~/mygadget $
```

## 00 The basic tracer

Since we want to observe everything regarding opening a file, we first need to
create an `eBPF` program. These are small little programs run inside the kernel,
without modifying it. We are writing them in C (with restrictions). You can
start by copying this template:

```c
// Kernel types definitions
// Check https://blog.aquasec.com/vmlinux.h-ebpf-programs for more details
#include <vmlinux.h>

// eBPF helpers signatures
// Check https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html to learn
// more about different available helpers
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

// Inspektor gadget helpers
// Check https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/gadget-devel/gadget-ebpf-api/
// to learn all details
#include <gadget/buffer.h>
#include <gadget/common.h>
#include <gadget/filter.h>
#include <gadget/macros.h>
#include <gadget/types.h>

// Our event structure
// First we only want to capture the timestamps when the open syscalls are called
struct event {
	gadget_timestamp timestamp_raw;
};

// This creates our tracer map and reservers space for 256k events
GADGET_TRACER_MAP(events, 1024 * 256);
// This macro specifies that this gadget provides tracing events
//  - open: This is the name of the datasource. It can be arbitrary and we will come back later to this
//  - events: This is the name of the map we created above
//  - event: This is the name of the event structure that we will put inside the events map
GADGET_TRACER(open, events, event);


static __always_inline int handle_open(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	struct event *event;

	// This is an Inspektor Gadget helper which checks if we should discard the
	// current data based on premade filters that we can set in Inspektor Gadget itself
	// So if we to Inspektor Gadget that our gadget should only trace a container
	// named "nginx-40", this function will return 0 for all other containers
	if (gadget_should_discard_data_current())
		return 0;

	// First we reserve space in the events map for our event
	event = gadget_reserve_buf(&events, sizeof(*event));
	if (!event)
		return 0;

	// We store the timestamp of the event
	event->timestamp_raw = bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns();

	// And finally we submit the event to the events map to be read by Inspektor Gadget
	// in userspace
	gadget_submit_buf(ctx, &events, event, sizeof(*event));

	return 0;
}

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat")
int openat_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx);
}

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
```

### Compilation and running

Before we change and extend this skeleton, we should learn how we can compile
our gadget and run it. In the provided dev VM we already installed `ig`, but to
follow on your own machine or later you need to follow the [Installation guide
on our page](https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/reference/install-linux).
After you have the local binary of Inspektor Gadget called `ig` installed, the
compilation is only a single line in the terminal: `sudo ig image build
path/to/gadget/dir -t tag.io/for/the/docker/image`. In our case we need to do

```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ig image build -t open .
Pulling builder image ghcr.io/inspektor-gadget/ebpf-builder@sha256:abde516ef837b9df6f8b70c9cd834cd4f0396d5b07e6a034906846c4935c7f24
ghcr.io/inspektor-gadget/ebpf-builder@sha256:abde516ef837b9df6f8b70c9cd834cd4f0396d5b07e6a034906846c4935c7f24: Pulling from inspektor-gadget/ebpf-builder

```

This also downloads and uses the `ebpf-builder` image which already contains
every binary, tool and header we need to build the gadget. Therefore, we don't
need to locally install anything else, which keeps our systems clean and
streamlined.

**Compiliation Errors** for `eBPF` can be quite cryptic. Feel free to ask for
help :)

After our gadget is successfully built and tagged as `open` we can run it the
following way:
```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ig run open --verify-image=false --fields +timestamp
```

To execute the gadget, we don't need to be in the same directory (and if we push
our gadget to OCI registries we can also use it on other hosts). We need the
`--verify-image=false` parameter here, since our gadget is not signed, but we
know its safe and can be trusted. Our skeleton of the gadget only has a single
field called `timestamp` and by default these are not shown. In our lab we want
them to be seen so we specify that the `timestamp` column should be included by
giving it a `+` prefix.

To see any events we need to generate some events. To do that, leave the `sudo
ig run` command running and open a second terminal or ssh session. For testing
purposes, we run an interactive docker container:
```bash
~ $ docker run -it --rm busybox
/ #
```

Just creating the container already created many events which can be seen

```bash
~ $ sudo ig run open --verify-image=false --fields +timestamp
WARN[0000] image signature verification is disabled due to using corresponding option
WARN[0000] Builder version not found in the gadget image. Gadget could be incompatible

2025-03-26T16:30:59.032466315+01:00
...
```

For this lab we can ignore these warnings, and I will cut it out of this
references console output to keep them small. It's good to see and know how our
gadget can be built and run easily. But our gadget only shows some timestamps.
We want more information and now we are diving into the code.

### Tracepoints

Because we want to trace everything opening a file, we need to attach our
program to the `openat` syscall:

```C
SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat")
int open_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return enter_open(ctx);
}
```

The `SEC(tracepoint/syscalls/` part instructs the framework to attach the
following program to a syscall. The remainder of `sys_enter_openat` specifies
that we want the program to be called right before the `openat` syscalls get
`enter`ed /executed. If we want to trace the exit out of `openat` we would need
to specify `sys_exit_openat`. The function name itself needs to be unique inside
our program. The parameter `struct syscall_trace_enter *` is required and we
will need it to extract some specific information. We will get back later to the
insides of that struct.

In the method body you see that we are just calling another function
`enter_openat`. That function actually contains all the logic we want to write.
We split that into its own separate function since there are actually **2**
different syscalls to open a file. One is `openat` and the second one `open`. We
don't know which of these syscalls the programs are calling so we should trace
both.

Your first task is to create a new function in the same file for `open` with the
correct `SEC(` and call `handle_open` in the function body.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```C
SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_open")
int open_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx);
}
```
</details>

### Event handling logic

When running our gadget we still only see some timestamps. All the logic for the
events is in the `handle_open` function. Before we extend the functionality
let's look what the current code does:

```C
	if (gadget_should_discard_data_current())
		return 0;
```
If you remember we needed to create a container to generate some events in our
gadget. But an eBPF program attached to a syscall can see every syscall
invocation on the host. Most of the time you don't want that, especially in the
Kubernetes scenario. The function `gadget_should_discard_data_current` helps us
to achieve that and provides premade filtering logic. For example, we can
already run our gadget and trace only events for a container named `nginx-40` by
running `sudo ig run open --verify-image=false  --fields +timestamp -c nginx-40`

```C
	event = gadget_reserve_buf(&events, sizeof(*event));
	if (!event)
		return 0;

	event->timestamp_raw = bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns();

	gadget_submit_buf(ctx, &events, event, sizeof(*event));
```

Here the first lines reserves a spot for our new event in the `events` map.
After setting the `timestamp_raw` member to the current timestamp we are
submitting the event. At this point Inspektor Gadget can read this event from
userspace and do all its magic.

Now we have all the information and can add more fields to our gadget. The
most important part would be getting all the container or Kubernetes information
where the event originated from. Therefore, if a file was opened in a container
named `MyContainer` we want to see that. Fortunately Inspektor Gadget helps us
out again and does the heavy lifting. The framework provides us with a special
structure named `gadget_process` that we need to include in our `struct event`
as a member. Populating that new member can also be done by calling
`gadget_process_populate(...)`. The documentation for `gadget_process_populate`
can be found [on our
website](https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/gadget-devel/gadget-ebpf-api#helpers)

Your next task is to add these parts in our gadget, so it can show container
information alongside its events

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```C
struct event {
	gadget_timestamp timestamp_raw;
	struct gadget_process proc;
};

//...

	event = gadget_reserve_buf(&events, sizeof(*event));
	if (!event)
		return 0;

	event->timestamp_raw = bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns();
	gadget_process_populate(&event->proc);

	gadget_submit_buf(ctx, &events, event, sizeof(*event));

```
</details>

After implementing this correctly, building and running the gadget, running some
commands in our test container should result in the following:
```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ./ig run open --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME													   COMM					PID		TID
vibrant_darwin															  sh				  3524211	3524211
vibrant_darwin															  sh				  3524211	3524211
```

And it shows us the container name, the command which executed the syscall and
more. Congratulations!

## 01 Filename

Now that we have some basic information about the events, we can expand our
gadget more. Until now we didn't do anything with the `struct
syscall_trace_enter *ctx` parameter besides passing them to some Inspektor
Gadget function.

Looking at the linux kernel source code at
[elixir.bootlin.com](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/kernel/trace/trace.h#L137)
we see that this struct also contains the arguments `args` of the system call in
an array.

Therefore, we should look up at which position the filename parameter. Looking
at the linux source code we see that the function definitions for
[`open`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/fs/open.c#L1421) and
[`openat`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/fs/open.c#L1428).

To decipher the function definition: The first macro parameter is the syscall
name. Then the parameters of the syscall is appended. First the type and then
the parameter name. For
[`open`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13.7/source/fs/open.c#L1421) the
function definition is

```C
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(open, const char __user *, filename, int, flags, umode_t, mode)
```

and therefore the filename should be found in `args[0]` inside the `struct
syscall_trace_enter`. We also need to cast the parameter to `const char *`.

For us to see the filename in our events we of course need a new member in our
`struct event`. We can't use pointers here, since we are crossing kernel and
user space boundaries. So we need to use a `char[256]` array. The size limit is
arbitrary and should be able to store the longest filenames.

Your task is to add the new struct member, a new `const char *` parameter to the
`handle_open` function and pass the correct argument from `ctx->args` to
`handle_open`. Do not try to copy the filename of the event yet, we will do that
afterwards. This should still compile fine, you should be able to see the new
column but it's not populated.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```C
struct event {
	gadget_timestamp timestamp_raw;
	struct gadget_process proc;
	char filename[256];
};

//...
static __always_inline int handle_open(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx, const char *filename)
//...

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat")
int openat_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx, (const char *)ctx->args[1]);
}

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_open")
int open_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx, (const char *)ctx->args[0]);
}

```
</details>

Running some commands in our test container gives the following:

```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ./ig run open --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME							 COMM					PID		TID FILENAME
vibrant_darwin									sh				  3524211	3524211
```

### Copying user space bytes

While looking at the `open` and `openat` you might have seen that there is a
`__user` annotation for the filename:

```C
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(open, const char __user *, filename, int, flags, umode_t, mode)
```

This means the provided filename pointer points to userspace memory and we can't
just directly access it here. To copy bytes out of it there is a eBPF helper
function called [`bpf_probe_read_user_str` (documentation
link)](https://docs.ebpf.io/linux/helper-function/bpf_probe_read_user_str/). The
first parameter is the destination buffer, the second the size (including NULL
terminator) and the third our userspace pointer (which is marked unsafe, since
it doesn't reside inside the kernel).

Now we have the final piece to copy the filename from the `args` into our new
`struct event` member. Your task is to actually copy it in the `handle_open`
function.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```C
	event = gadget_reserve_buf(&events, sizeof(*event));
	if (!event)
		return 0;

	event->timestamp_raw = bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns();
	gadget_process_populate(&event->proc);
	bpf_probe_read_user_str(&event->filename, sizeof(event->filename), filename);

	gadget_submit_buf(ctx, &events, event, sizeof(*event));
```
</details>

Now when running a simple `echo foo > bar` command in our test container we can
see the following output when we have our gadget running:

```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ./ig run open --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME							 COMM					PID		TID FILENAME
vibrant_darwin									sh				  3524211	3524211 bar
```

Now we are able to see which command in which container access which file on the
filesystem 🎉

## 02 Flags while opening a file

There are other parameters in the `open` and `openat` systemcall, which might
interest us:

```C
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(open, const char __user *, filename, int, flags, umode_t, mode)
```

One of them is `flags` which specifies how the kernel should open these files.
For example if a program only wants to read a file, it can be opened with the
`O_RDONLY` flag. This information might be useful for us, so let's add it to our
gadget.

Your task is now to add `flags` to our `struct event`. We need to read it from
`struct syscall_trace_enter` for `open` and `openat`, give it as parameter to
`handle_open`, where we finally write it into our event.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```C
struct event {
	gadget_timestamp timestamp_raw;
	struct gadget_process proc;
	char filename[256];
	int flags;
};

//...

static __always_inline int handle_open(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx, const char *filename, int flags)
{
//...
	event->timestamp_raw = bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns();
	gadget_process_populate(&event->proc);
	bpf_probe_read_user_str(&event->filename, sizeof(event->filename), filename);
	event->flags = flags;
//...
}


//...

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_openat")
int openat_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx, (const char *)ctx->args[1], (int)ctx->args[2]);
}

SEC("tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_open")
int open_entry(struct syscall_trace_enter *ctx)
{
	return handle_open(ctx, (const char *)ctx->args[0], (int)ctx->args[1]);
}
```

</details>

When building and running our gadget, we can again run some commands in our test
container and see the results:

```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ./ig run open --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME					 COMM					PID		TID FILENAME			  FLAGS
vibrant_darwin							sh				  3524211	3524211 bar				   577
```

We now can see the flags in our events. To make it more readable we can process
that field in userspace with Go/WASM. This step is optional and we are doing it
as a last step.

## 03 Share our gadget with the world

When you are happy with your gadget and want to share it with the world (or in
your own private registry) we can upload it to any OCI compliant registry. While
developing we tagged our gadget with `open` which defaults to
`ghcr.io/inspektor-gadget/gadget/open`. For local development it doesn't matter,
but you can't upload it to the Inspektor Gadget repository.

For lab testing purposes we can use [the `ttl.sh` registry](https://ttl.sh/). It
allows anonymous image pushing and pulling and saves the oci images for a
specified time. Please choose a unique tag (best would be to use `uuidgen`).

To tag our image correctly we can specify it while building it
```bash
~/mygadget $ ID=$(uuidgen)
~/mygadget $ sudo -E ig image build -t ttl.sh/$ID .
```
or we can retag our existing built gadget
```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo -E ig image tag open ttl.sh/$ID
```

and then we can finally push it to the registry:
```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo -E ig image tag open ttl.sh/$ID
Successfully tagged with ttl.sh/9272b90f-a23e-4457-bc84-e3f6106cba31:latest@sha256:d88da3ac5e383127853c23f0caf93312d8a277bae22bd3122d4dde5212103a75

~/mygadget $ sudo -E ig image push ttl.sh/$ID
Pushing ttl.sh/9272b90f-a23e-4457-bc84-e3f6106cba31...
Successfully pushed ttl.sh/9272b90f-a23e-4457-bc84-e3f6106cba31:latest@sha256:d88da3ac5e383127853c23f0caf93312d8a277bae22bd3122d4dde5212103a75
```

And that is all we have to do. We can go to any machine which has `ig` installed
and can run our own gadget:

```
~/mygadget $ sudo ig run ttl.sh/<the_same_id_here> --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME					 COMM					PID		TID FILENAME			  FLAGS
vibrant_darwin							sh				  3524211	3524211 bar				   577
```

## 04 Optional: Userspace processing with Go/WASM

If you remember, the output of our gadget looks currently like this:
```bash
~/mygadget $ sudo ig run open --verify-image=false
RUNTIME.CONTAINERNAME					 COMM					PID		TID FILENAME			  FLAGS
vibrant_darwin							sh				  3524211	3524211 bar				   577
```

Everything is quite usable besides the `FLAGS` column. It would be optimal if we
can take the integer and decode it back into the flags that were given to the
`open` or `openat` syscall.

For that we can process our events in userspace with Go/WASM. We can instruct
Inspektor Gadget to build the userspace component by adding a file named
`build.yaml` next to our `program.bpf.c` with the following content:

```yaml
wasm: go/main.go
```

Then, create the folder `go` and inside it a file named `main.go` with the
following template code:

```go
package main

import (
	api "github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/wasmapi/go"
)

var flagNames = []string{
	"O_CREAT",
	"O_EXCL",
	"O_NOCTTY",
	"O_TRUNC",
	"O_APPEND",
	"O_NONBLOCK",
	"O_DSYNC",
	"O_FASYNC",
	"O_DIRECT",
	"O_LARGEFILE",
	"O_DIRECTORY",
	"O_NOFOLLOW",
	"O_NOATIME",
	"O_CLOEXEC",
}

func decodeFlags(flags int32) []string {
	flagsStr := []string{}

	// We first need to deal with the first 3 bits which indicates access mode.
	switch flags & 0b11 {
	case 0:
		flagsStr = append(flagsStr, "O_RDONLY")
	case 1:
		flagsStr = append(flagsStr, "O_WRONLY")
	case 2:
		flagsStr = append(flagsStr, "O_RDWR")
	}

	// Then, we need to remove the last 6 bits and we can deal with the other
	// flags.
	// Indeed, O_CREAT is defined as 00000100, see:
	// https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9d646009f65d/include/uapi/asm-generic/fcntl.h#L24
	flags >>= 6
	for i, val := range flagNames {
		if (1<<i)&flags != 0 {
			flagsStr = append(flagsStr, val)
		}
	}

	return flagsStr
}

//go:wasmexport gadgetInit
func gadgetInit() int32 {
	// We named our datasource "open" in the eBPF programs when specifying "open" as the
	// first parameter in     GADGET_TRACER(open, events, event);
	// All events originated from there are then under the "open" datasource.
	ds, err := api.GetDataSource("open")
	if err != nil {
		api.Errorf("failed to get datasource: %s", err)
		return 1
	}

	// We need to read the "flags" field which is published in the "open" datasource
	// and therefore we need access to the field.
	flagsField, err := ds.GetField("flags")
	if err != nil {
		api.Errorf("failed to get field: %s", err)
		return 1
	}

	// We are going to put our decoded flags in a new field called "flags_decoded"
	// which is going to be a string.
	// Since we want it to be in the same datasource "open", lets add it there
	flagsDecodedField, err := ds.AddField("flags_decoded", api.Kind_String)
	if err != nil {
		api.Errorf("failed to add field: %s", err)
		return 1
	}

	// We subscribe to the datasource and we are going to decode the flags
	// and put them in the new field.
	// The callback is going to be called for each event in the datasource.
	ds.Subscribe(func(source api.DataSource, data api.Data) {

		// Put your code in here

	}, 0)

	return 0
}

func main() {}

```

and the `go.mod` file with the following content:

```
module main

go 1.23.0

require github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget v0.46.0
```

Inspektor Gadget will look at `go/main.go`, try to compile that package into
WASM and include it in our gadget. Looking at the template we can see that the
flag decoding function is already implemented. It takes an `int32` and returns
us `[]string`, which are the decoded flags.

We also have the `flagsField`, which is the handler to read the `int flags` of
our `struct event`. Additionally we create a new field named "flags_decoded" and
its corresponding handler is `flagsDecodedField`. Both handlers are of type
`Field`.

The function given to `ds.Subscribe` is getting called for every event. So the
logic and enrichment needs to happen there. This means reading the `int32` out
of `flagsField`, decoding it with `decodeFlags` and finally set the string into
`flagsDecodedField`.

Your task is to implement the body of that function. It is marked in the
template and you only need to extend that area.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```golang
	ds.Subscribe(func(source api.DataSource, data api.Data) {
		flagsRaw, err := flagsField.Int32(data)
		if err != nil {
			api.Warnf("failed to get flags: %s", err)
			return
		}

		flagsStrArr := decodeFlags(flagsRaw)
		flagsDecodedField.SetString(data, strings.Join(flagsStrArr, "|"))
	}, 0)
```
</details>

After rebuilding our gadget we can see the new field with its content:

```bash

If your output gets truncated, you can either resize our terminal or use the
`json`/`jsonpretty` output mode with `-o json`/`-o jsonpretty` which should show
you all the fields currently available. Many of them we didn't see in this lab
and ignored it:

```json
~/mygadget $ sudo ./ig run open --verify-image=false -o jsonpretty
{
  "filename": "bar",
  "flags": 577,
  "flags_decoded": "O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC",
...
  "proc": {
	"comm": "sh",
	"creds": {
	  "gid": 0,
	  "group": "root",
	  "uid": 0,
	  "user": "root"
	},
	"mntns_id": 4026532426,
	"parent": {
	  "comm": "containerd-shim",
	  "pid": 3524190
	},
	"pid": 3524211,
	"tid": 3524211
  },
  "runtime": {
	"containerId": "16a5318354133f73ba4e5bfa0a19a2eaa8fb1234ef15f1867d8fd789baad6f71",
	"containerImageDigest": "sha256:9ae97d36d26566ff84e8893c64a6dc4fe8ca6d1144bf5b87b2b85a32def253c7",
	"containerImageName": "busybox",
	"containerName": "vibrant_darwin",
	"containerPid": 3524211,
	"containerStartedAt": 1743003058982344231,
	"runtimeName": "docker"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T18:26:41.286624603+01:00",
  "timestamp_raw": 1743096401286624603
}
```

In my example we can see that the `sh` process in the container named
`vibrant_darwin`, which is a `busybox` image opened a file named `bar` with the
flags `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`
